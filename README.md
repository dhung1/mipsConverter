## mipsConverter  
This is a helper script which converts MIPS assembly code into its binary equivalent, including optional Verilog support. This was originally created for ECE 369 at the University of Arizona  

To check usage, simply invoke  
```python mipsConverter.py -h```  

Typical usage will likely look like  
```python mipsConverter.py -i mips_code.s -o verilog_code.v -bx```  

This script is a work in progress. If you are interested in contributing, please reach out to davidhung@email.arizona.edu
